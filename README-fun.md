# aver: A Versioned Knowledge Tracking Tool
## A Quest for the Perfect Record

In an age of crumbling servers, forgotten spreadsheets, and SaaS subscriptions that devoured kingdoms… a fellowship arose in search of a better way.

## **Prologue: The Problem in the Realm**

Across the lands, many orders struggled:

- Records lost to dead platforms
- Knowledge buried in email tombs
- Notes scattered like ashes in the wind
- Tools that required mighty infrastructure beasts just to stay alive

The sages all agreed:

> "There must be a way to keep structured records…
> With history… with search…
> Without summoning a server daemon."

Thus began the quest.

## **The Fellowship of Seekers**

Each hero came from a different discipline, seeking the same tool:

A system to track evolving knowledge over time — safely, portably, and without dark magic.

### **Lyra Quillshade — Bard of the Publishing Guild**

Lyra's struggles were many:

- Manuscripts full of continuity errors
- Fact-checking notes lost in margins
- Editorial decisions trapped in comment threads
- Versions of drafts scattered across realms

She sought:

> "A living ledger of story issues,
> Where every note is remembered,
> Every revision traced,
> And nothing is locked in cursed proprietary scrolls."

She found a tool where each Record could be:

- A continuity issue
- A fact-check request
- A layout problem
- A rights and permissions question

Each tied to chapters, characters, and drafts — searchable forever.

Lyra wept (poetically).

### **Null Pointer — Rogue Software Bounty Hunter**

Null had hunted bugs in many kingdoms:

- Ticket systems that required tribute (monthly billing cycles)
- Platforms that vanished, taking issues with them
- Tools that could not travel offline
- Histories hidden behind glass dashboards

Null wanted:

> "Plain text. Full history. No gatekeepers."

He found a tool where:

- Every issue lived as a file
- Every change was recorded in Git history
- Search was fast, local, and rebuildable
- No server dragon needed feeding

Null nodded once. High praise.

### **Dr. Aria Voss — Scientific Sorcerer of the Seventh Lab**

Aria tracked:

- Experimental anomalies
- Equipment misbehavior
- Environmental drift
- Observations that did not fit the model

Her previous tools were:

- Spreadsheets of despair
- Paper notebooks of entropy
- Institutional systems that no one maintained

She needed:

> "A versioned, searchable lab logbook
> That speaks both human and machine."

With structured metadata, she could now ask:

- "Show all runs where temperature > 37°C"
- "All anomalies involving centrifuge-3"

Her lab notes became queryable history.

The data spirits were appeased.

### **Toren Steelhand — Field Engineer of the Outer Works**

Toren maintained:

- Machines older than some empires
- Equipment in places where the signal bars went to die
- Logs written on clipboards and later forgotten

He required:

> "A rugged log that works offline,
> Syncs when it can,
> And doesn't demand a glowing web altar."

He found:

- Records stored locally
- Sync through Git when back in civilization
- Structured fields for pressure, temperature, batch, and shift

For the first time, field notes and central history matched.

Toren approved with a single grunt.

---

### **Elarion the Infinite — World-Building Deity & Dungeon Master**

Elarion ruled:

- A sprawling world
- Hundreds of NPCs
- Dozens of unresolved plot threads
- Players who delighted in derailing destiny

He lamented:

> "I cannot remember what happened 14 sessions ago in the ruined city of Valemire."

With the tool, each Record became:

- A quest
- An NPC arc
- A world event
- A faction scheme

Each session added Notes.

He could now ask:

- "All active quests in the Ashlands"
- "NPCs currently hostile to the party"
- "Plot threads untouched for 5 sessions"

Canon was preserved. Retcons were minimized. Chaos remained… but documented.

### **The Artifact They Discovered**

At journey's end, the fellowship uncovered not a cloud platform, nor a SaaS throne…

But something older. Simpler. Stronger.

✨ **aver: A Versioned Knowledge Tracking Tool**

A tool that provides:

- Plain-text records (human-readable, future-proof)
- Structured metadata (queryable, sortable)
- Full version history (via Git)
- Fast local search (via SQLite index)
- No required server
- Rebuildable index from source files

It does not replace your craft.

It simply remembers everything for you.

---

## The Laws of the Artifact

The fellowship soon learned that the artifact was powerful —
but not without limits.

It obeyed certain laws, older than any kingdom:

- It remembered every change, but judged no truth
- It spoke only in plain text, readable by any who could read
- It hid nothing behind servers, daemons, or glowing altars
- It imposed no meanings of its own — only structure
- It preserved the present in Records, and the past in Notes
- It could lose its index and suffer no lasting harm

These laws were not flaws.
They were the reason the artifact endured.

---

## **What This Tool Is**

A file-native system for tracking structured records with history and search.

Used for:

- Software issues
- Research logs
- Engineering deviations
- Editorial tracking
- Campaign lore
- And any evolving body of knowledge that deserves to be recorded and recalled

---

## **What It Is Not**

- Not a real-time alerting system
- Not a corporate workflow labyrinth
- Not a dashboard empire

It is a verified record, not a command center.

---

## **Epilogue**

And so the heroes returned to their domains:

- The Bard with her manuscripts
- The Rogue with his bugs
- The Sorcerer with her experiments
- The Engineer with his machines
- The Deity with their world

All carrying the same artifact.

A simple truth, etched into plain text:

> What matters should be recorded.
> What is recorded should be searchable.
> What is searchable should endure.

**aver awaits your first entry.**

title: Add 'tlogger' type k/v assignments
type: feature
status: new
severity: ''

TLogger was a "tagged logger" developed by dentm42 about 10 years ago.

It allowed embedded key/value mappings within the text.

This would be a great feature, allowing records and updates to have key/value
assignments embedded in the content.  It would require parsing those and adding
them to the k/v stores.

This is where the various k/v operators ($,%,#) will come in very handy.

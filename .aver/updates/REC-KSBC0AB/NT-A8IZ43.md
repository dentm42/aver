Updated: status, full record (TOML edit)

## PREVIOUS RECORD TEXT
Instead of just a text block - create the TOML header prior to dumping into the text editor allowing the user to update field.

SYSTEM fields should be excluded.
REQUIRED fields should be marked with __required

Also - remove the #comments - since this is MD, the # is a heading delimiter not a comment.
